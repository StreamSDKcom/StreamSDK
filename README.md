# StreamSDK
This is StreamSDK (currently for Unity); a programmable, real-time interactive streaming engine. It allows real-time streaming of any content Unity can render (audio, video, and input). Create video chat, cloud games, remote rendering, etc. StreamSDK Works on all platforms Any-to-Anyâ„¢.
 
# Use Cases

**Video Chat**

Connect people remotely for live conversations across platforms, one-to-one or many-to-many!

**Cloud Gaming**

Host games on one machine and play them from any other machine from anywhere in the world!

**Remote Rendering**

Render high-end graphics on a powerful computer and stream them for real-time manipulation on a low-end device as if it were natively rendered!

**XR Sharing**

Share the contents of a VR or AR experience outside the headset, to anyone in the world in real-time!

**Film**

Combine real-time graphics and video on-the-fly from multiple vantage points without wires!

**Advertising**

Allow demo access to games or other commercial apps, even high-end, on any device! Get creative!

**Live Support**

Allow an expert to remote control an app in the field!

**Audio Streaming**

Stream just audio, in real-time for surround sound systems, voice chat, or music streaming!

**Quality Assurance**

Keep tabs on the game or app you are developing without standing over the shoulder of your testers!

**Remote Collaboration**

Fuse a multitude of elements together to create rich real-time remote collaboration experiences!

**Peer-to-Peer Play**

Allow players to connect while playing different games and even allow them to switch controls allowing a game to be played on a platform it was never published on!

**Edge Computing**

Stream real-time audio/video/input from a mobile device to a more powerful computer to process machine learning with unbound memory!

**Machine Learning**

Capture data remotely and real-time stream it to a datastore for model building!

**Computer Vision**

Allow multiple models running on different sources to feed data back simultaneously for more powerful inference capabilities!

**Synthetic Data**

When rendering digital twins out to training data, parallelize the process with different filters or effects on different clients. Massive time savings, without any network sync issues!

**Decentralized Game Rental**

Allow a game/hardware combination to be rented by remote thin clients!

**Hyper-Exclusive Content**

Create limited run experiences that can be fully utilized without sharing any source code!

**Game/App Hyperlinking**

Allow easy and instantaneous access between multiple remote games or apps without having to load anything!

**Remote Control Systems**

Create complex systems that can be accessed remotely from any platform with no downloads or security risks!
